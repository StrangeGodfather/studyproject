#
# This is the main IBM HTTP server configuration file.  It contains the
# configuration directives that give the server its instructions.
# See <URL:http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/httpserv/manual70/> for detailed 
# information about the Apache directives.
#
# The instructions provided in this configuration file are only hints or
# reminders.  Consult the online docs for definitive information.
#
# The configuration directives are grouped into three basic sections:
#  1. Directives that control the operation of the web server process as a
#     whole (the 'global environment').
#  2. Directives that define the parameters of the 'main' or 'default' server,
#     which responds to requests that aren't handled by a virtual host.
#     These directives also provide default values for the settings
#     of all virtual hosts.
#  3. Settings for virtual hosts, which allow Web requests to be sent to
#     different IP addresses or hostnames and have them handled by the
#     same web server process.
#
# Configuration and logfile names: If the filenames you specify for many
# of the server's control files begin with "/" (or "drive:/" for Win32), the
# server will use that explicit path.  If the filenames do *not* begin
# with "/", the value of ServerRoot is prepended -- so "logs/foo.log"
# with ServerRoot set to "C:/IBM/HTTPServer" will be interpreted by the
# server as "C:/IBM/HTTPServer/logs/foo.log".
#
# NOTE: Where filenames are specified, you must use forward slashes
# instead of backslashes (e.g., "c:/IHS" instead of "c:\IHS").
# If a drive letter is omitted, the drive on which HTTPD.EXE is located
# will be used by default.  It is recommended that you always supply
# an explicit drive letter in absolute paths, however, to avoid
# confusion.
#

### Section 1: Global Environment
#
# The directives in this section affect the overall operation of IBM HTTP
# Server, such as the number of concurrent requests it can handle or where 
# it can find its configuration files.
#

#
# ServerRoot: The top of the directory tree under which the server's
# configuration, error, and log files are kept.
#
# Do NOT add a slash at the end of the directory path.
#
ServerRoot "C:/IBM/HTTPServer"

#
# PidFile: The file in which the server should record its process
# identification number when it starts.
#
PidFile logs/httpd.pid

#
# Timeout: The number of seconds before receives and sends time out.
#
Timeout 300

#
# KeepAlive: Whether or not to allow persistent connections (more than
# one request per connection). Set to "Off" to deactivate.
#
KeepAlive On

#
# MaxKeepAliveRequests: The maximum number of requests to allow
# during a persistent connection. Set to 0 to allow an unlimited amount.
# We recommend you leave this number high, for maximum performance.
#
MaxKeepAliveRequests 100

#
# KeepAliveTimeout: Number of seconds to wait for the next request from the
# same client on the same connection.
#
KeepAliveTimeout 10

##
## Server-Pool Size Regulation (MPM specific)
## 

# Windows MPM
#
# For tuning recommendations, refer to <NEWINFOCENTERURL>.
#
# ThreadLimit: maximum setting of ThreadsPerChild
# ThreadsPerChild: constant number of worker threads in each server process
# MaxRequestsPerChild: maximum number of requests a server process serves
<IfModule mpm_winnt.c>
ThreadLimit         600
ThreadsPerChild     600
MaxRequestsPerChild  0

#
# Listen: Allows you to bind the web server to specific IP addresses 
# and/or ports, in addition to the default. See also the <VirtualHost>
# directive.
#
# Listen directives must be qualified with either an IPv4 or IPv6 address.
# Use 0.0.0.0 for the default IPv4 address and [::] for the default IPv6
# address.
#
# IPv4 support:
Listen 0.0.0.0:80
# Uncomment the following line for IPv6 support on Windows XP or Windows
# 2003 or later.  Windows IPv6 networking must be configured first.
# Listen [::]:80

# Dynamic Shared Object (DSO) Support
#
# To be able to use the functionality of a module which was built as a DSO you
# have to place corresponding `LoadModule' lines at this location so the

#
# ExtendedStatus controls whether the web server will generate "full"
# status information (ExtendedStatus On) or just basic information 
# (ExtendedStatus Off) when the server status page is formatted or
# when IBM HTTP Server diagnostic modules report information.  The
# default is Off.

### Section 2: 'Main' server configuration
#
# The directives in this section set up the values used by the 'main'
# server, which responds to any requests that aren't handled by a
# <VirtualHost> definition.  These values also provide defaults for
# any <VirtualHost> containers you may define later in the file.
#
# All of these directives may appear inside <VirtualHost> containers,
# in which case these default settings will be overridden for the
# virtual host being defined.
#

#
# ServerAdmin: Your address, where problems with the server should be
# e-mailed.  This address appears on some server-generated pages, such
# as error documents.  e.g. admin@your-domain.com
#
ServerAdmin you@your.address

#
# ServerName gives the name and port that the server uses to identify itself.
# This can often be determined automatically, but we recommend you specify
# it explicitly to prevent problems during startup.
#
# If this is not set to valid DNS name for your host, server-generated
# redirections will not work.  See also the UseCanonicalName directive.
#
# If your host doesn't have a registered DNS name, enter its IP address here.
# You will have to access it by its address anyway, and this will make 
# redirections work in a sensible way.
#

#TraceEnable off ######By JEREMY 2013-2-27
#
# UseCanonicalName: Determines how the web server constructs self-
# referencing URLs and the SERVER_NAME and SERVER_PORT variables.
# When set "Off", the web server will use the Hostname and Port supplied
# by the client.  When set "On", it will use the value of the ServerName
# directive.

# ServerTokens
# This directive configures what you return as the Server HTTP response
# Header. The built-in default is 'Full' which sends information about 
# the OS-type and compiled in modules.  The recommended value is 'Prod' 
# which sends the least information.
# Set to one of:  Full | OS | Minor | Minimal | Major | Prod

# Putting this all together, we can internationalize error responses.
#
# We use Alias to redirect any /error/HTTP_<error>.html.var response to
# our collection of by-error message multi-language collections.  We use 
# includes to substitute the appropriate text.
#
# You can modify the messages' appearance without changing any of the
# default HTTP_<error>.html.var files by adding the line:
#
#   Alias /error/include/ "/your/include/path/"
#
# which allows you to create your own set of files by starting with the
# C:/IBM/HTTPServer/error/include/ files and copying them to /your/include/path/, 
# even on a per-VirtualHost basis.  The default include files will display
# your IBM HTTP Server version number and your ServerAdmin email address
# regardless of the setting of ServerSignature.

### Section 3: Virtual Hosts
#
# VirtualHost: If you want to maintain multiple domains/hostnames on your
# machine you can setup VirtualHost containers for them. Most configurations
# use only name-based virtual hosts so the server doesn't need to worry about
# IP addresses. This is indicated by the asterisks in the directives below.
#
# Please see the documentation at 
# <URL:http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/httpserv/manual70/vhosts/>
# for further details before you try to setup virtual hosts.
#
# You may use the command line option '-S' to verify your virtual host
# configuration.

#
# Use name-based virtual hosting.
#
#NameVirtualHost *

#
# VirtualHost example:
# Almost any Apache directive may go into a VirtualHost container.
# The first VirtualHost section is used for requests without a known
# server name.
#
#<VirtualHost *>
#    ServerAdmin webmaster@dummy-host.example.com
#    DocumentRoot /www/docs/dummy-host.example.com
#    ServerName dummy-host.example.com
#    ErrorLog logs/dummy-host.example.com-error.log
#    CustomLog logs/dummy-host.example.com-access.log common
#</VirtualHost>

# Example SSL configuration which supports SSLv3 and TLSv1
# To enable this support:
#   1) Create a key database with ikeyman
#   2) Update the KeyFile directive below to point to that key database
#   3) Uncomment the directives up through the end of the example
#      Note: The IPv6 Listen directive must only be uncommented if
#      IPv6 networking is enabled.
